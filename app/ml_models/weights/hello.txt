Absir Ahmed Khan: Here to help. How's it going? I haven't seen you in forever.
Rihab Rabbani: I've said, Oh my God, it's been but like three months. I am doing well, just
Rihab Rabbani: super busy with work. How about you?
Absir Ahmed Khan: Yeah, roughly that I've been good. Can't complain work. Has been pretty hectic
Absir Ahmed Khan: on my end too. We are in the middle of this massive project launch and it feels
Absir Ahmed Khan: like we are working around the clock.
Rihab Rabbani: Oh no that sounds exhausting. What kind of project is it? Or is it one of those
Rihab Rabbani: top secret things you can talk about?
Absir Ahmed Khan: Not exactly top secret but it is confidential until the official announcement.
Absir Ahmed Khan: Let's just say it is a digital platform that is supposed to streamline a lot of
Absir Ahmed Khan: client operations. The timeline is super tight though which is why everyone's
Absir Ahmed Khan: been pulling long hours.
Rihab Rabbani: I can imagine tech projects always seem to have impossible deadlines. At least
Rihab Rabbani: you are working on something that sounds impactful I have been dealing with my
Rihab Rabbani: own house at the office. We just destructed, our entire marketing department and
Rihab Rabbani: I am still trying to figure out where I fit into the new here.
Absir Ahmed Khan: Oh, well, restriction is never fun. Is it one of those situations where
Absir Ahmed Khan: everyone's roles changed or just shuffling of teams?
Rihab Rabbani: A bit of both honestly they combine two departments and created these new
Rihab Rabbani: positions that didn't exist before I technically had the same title but my
Rihab Rabbani: responsibilities have shifted quite a bit and now overseeing social media
Rihab Rabbani: strategy and content creation, which is actually pretty exciting but that's
Rihab Rabbani: transition period has been rough.
Absir Ahmed Khan: That does sound exciting though. Social media, strategies, huge right now, every
Absir Ahmed Khan: company is trying to figure out how to stay relevant online. Are you enjoying
Absir Ahmed Khan: the new responsibilities?
Rihab Rabbani: I am actually it is challenging, but in good way, I get to be more creative than
Rihab Rabbani: I was before. The only downside is that I am working with a completely new team.
Rihab Rabbani: So, there is this whole getting to know everyone. Please please. Some people are
Rihab Rabbani: great. But there are few who seems there's this thing to the changes.
Absir Ahmed Khan: Yeah, change management is tricky. There is always going to be people who prefer
Absir Ahmed Khan: the old way of doing things give it some time, though, I'm sure they'll come
Absir Ahmed Khan: around once they see the benefits of the new structure.
Rihab Rabbani: I hope so. Anyway, enough about work stress. How is your family doing your
Rihab Rabbani: sister just got married, right?
Absir Ahmed Khan: Yes, the wedding was back in August, it was absolutely beautiful. But also
Absir Ahmed Khan: completely exhausting, you know, they see weddings are three days of non-stop
Absir Ahmed Khan: events relatives everywhere and everyone has an opinion about everything.
Rihab Rabbani: That sounds lovely. I love Islamabad weddings. The venue. There are always. So
Rihab Rabbani: elegant, is your sister setting in well with her new in laws.
Absir Ahmed Khan: She is thankfully she moved to Lahore which is a bit of an adjustment since
Absir Ahmed Khan: we're all here in Rahul Bindi, but she visits pretty regularly, her husband's
Absir Ahmed Khan: family. Seems really nice. They're very welcoming which makes my parents feel
Absir Ahmed Khan: better about the whole thing.
Rihab Rabbani: That's weird to hear. It's always a really when the in laws are good people. My
Rihab Rabbani: cousin just got engaged and we are already deep into wedding planning mode. It's
Rihab Rabbani: not until next summer, but you had think it was happening. Next month with house
Rihab Rabbani: just everyone is
Absir Ahmed Khan: Starting early is probably smart though, these things take forever to organize.
Absir Ahmed Khan: Have they decided on a venue yet?
Rihab Rabbani: They are still looking, they want something in Ralpindi, but with a more modern
Rihab Rabbani: aesthetic, most of the traditional venues are either too expensive or they are
Rihab Rabbani: already booked for next year. It is surprisingly competitive.
Absir Ahmed Khan: The wedding industry. Here is insane. I heard some menus are booking dates two
Absir Ahmed Khan: years in advance. Now, it is becoming like trying to reserve a table at a
Absir Ahmed Khan: popular restaurant.
Rihab Rabbani: Exactly. And don't even get me started on the course. Everything has gotten so
Rihab Rabbani: expensive. Even the simplest things like floral arrangements, or catering cost,
Rihab Rabbani: and arm and a leg. Now,
Absir Ahmed Khan: Inflation has it? I inflation as it. Everything pretty hard. I was looking at
Absir Ahmed Khan: car prices the other day, just out of curiosity and then nearly had a heart
Absir Ahmed Khan: attack. The same models that were affordable a few years ago are now priced
Absir Ahmed Khan: ridiculously high.
Rihab Rabbani: Tell me about it. I wanted to upgrade my phone recently and the price were
Rihab Rabbani: outrageous. I ended up just getting my current phone prepared. Instead it is
Rihab Rabbani: frustrating because series haven't increased proportionally at all.
Absir Ahmed Khan: That's the real problem isn't it? Everything costs more but we are all making
Absir Ahmed Khan: roughly the same amount. It makes you wonder how people are managing, especially
Absir Ahmed Khan: those families especially those with families who support
Rihab Rabbani: It is definitely tough. My parents are retired now, and I can see how much they
Rihab Rabbani: have to budget carefully. Their constantly comparing prices and looking for
Rihab Rabbani: deals. It makes me more conscious about my own spending too.
Absir Ahmed Khan: Same here, I have become much more intentional about where my money goes. I used
Absir Ahmed Khan: to eat out pretty regularly but now I'm cooking at home more, it's healthier and
Absir Ahmed Khan: cheaper so I guess that's a silver lining.
Rihab Rabbani: That's actually impressive. I keep telling myself, I will cook more but then I
Rihab Rabbani: get home exhausted and end up ordering something. What kind of things do you
Rihab Rabbani: cook?
Absir Ahmed Khan: Nothing too fancy. Mostly simple Pakistani dishes. Dial chicken. Kadahi biryani
Absir Ahmed Khan: on weekends. When I have more time, I learned a lot from watching my mom and
Absir Ahmed Khan: honestly, YouTube cooking channels have been a lifesaver.
Rihab Rabbani: YouTube is amazing for that. I have watched so many cooking videos with full
Rihab Rabbani: intentions of trying them, but I never actually do. Maybe need. I need to
Rihab Rabbani: actually commit to it. Do you follow any specific channels?
Absir Ahmed Khan: There are a few good ones. Some focus on quick meals, which is what I need for
Absir Ahmed Khan: weekdays the 30 minute recipe videos are my favorite. I don't have the patience
Absir Ahmed Khan: for anything that takes hours.
Rihab Rabbani: And that makes sense, especially with your work schedule. Speaking of which do
Rihab Rabbani: you think things will come down after your project launches or is there already
Rihab Rabbani: something else lined up?
Absir Ahmed Khan: There's always something else. Unfortunately, that's the nature of only industry
Absir Ahmed Khan: but I'm hoping to take some time off. Once this phase is complete. I haven't had
Absir Ahmed Khan: a proper vacation in over a year and I'm definitely feeling the burnout.
Rihab Rabbani: You definitely deserve a break, any idea where you had want to go.
Absir Ahmed Khan: I've been thinking about the northern areas, actually, maybe Honda or Skardu.
Absir Ahmed Khan: I've seen so many beautiful photos from friends who have visited and it looks
Absir Ahmed Khan: incredibly peaceful. Plus, it would be nice to disconnect from work for a bit
Absir Ahmed Khan: and just enjoy nature.
Rihab Rabbani: Oh, that would be amazing. The knot is absolutely stunning, especially that this
Rihab Rabbani: time of year when the weather is perfect. I went to neuron last year with some
Rihab Rabbani: friends, and it was one of the best clips I have ever taken. The landscapes are
Rihab Rabbani: just breathtaking.
Absir Ahmed Khan: Naran is on my list too. Did you do any tracking or was it more of a relaxed
Absir Ahmed Khan: trip?
Rihab Rabbani: We did a both of both. There were, there was a moderate flag to circle mallu.
Rihab Rabbani: That was challenging, but to
Absir Ahmed Khan: That sounds perfect. I think I need something. Exactly like that. Some light
Absir Ahmed Khan: adventure mixed with relaxation. Just being in the mountains, sounds
Absir Ahmed Khan: therapeutic.
Rihab Rabbani: person than in pictures. We also spent a lot of time just driving around and
Rihab Rabbani: stopping at different viewpoints.
Rihab Rabbani: It's really is, there's something about being surrounded by those massive
Rihab Rabbani: message, peaks and fresh air, get puts everything into perspective. All the
Rihab Rabbani: books stress in daily, worry, seems so small in comparison.
Absir Ahmed Khan: I could use that perspective shift right about now sometimes I get so caught up
Absir Ahmed Khan: in deadlines and deliverables that I forget there's a whole world outside of
Absir Ahmed Khan: work, emails and meetings
Absir Ahmed Khan: I used to bleak record regularly with some friends but lately we haven't been
Rihab Rabbani: I totally understand that feeling. It is easy to get tunnel vision when you are
Rihab Rabbani: into the thick of it. That's why taking breaks is so important. Even if it's
Absir Ahmed Khan: able to coordinate schedules. Everyone has been busy with their own stuff. I've
Rihab Rabbani: just small ones, do you have any hobbies outside of work?
Absir Ahmed Khan: been trying to read more though. I set a goal to finish one book a month.
Rihab Rabbani: Ahmed? That's a good goal. How is it going? Are you managing to keep up with it?
Absir Ahmed Khan: Hit and miss. To be honest, some months I finished two books because I get
Absir Ahmed Khan: really into them another months. I barely read at all right, now I'm reading
Absir Ahmed Khan: this historical, things fiction about the mobile era, it is fascinating but
Absir Ahmed Khan: quite dense.
Rihab Rabbani: Historical fiction can be a really engaging when it's done. Well, I have been
Rihab Rabbani: more into come contemporary friction directly, just finished this book about a
Rihab Rabbani: family encouraging dealing with generational conflicts. It was very relatable.
Absir Ahmed Khan: That does sound interesting. I should probably diversify. What I read, I tend to
Absir Ahmed Khan: stick to the game, your attend to stick to the same genres, maybe you should
Absir Ahmed Khan: swap recommendations sometime
Rihab Rabbani: Definitely, I had loved that. We should also plan to actually hang out more
Rihab Rabbani: regularly. It is regular ridiculous that we live in the same city and barely see
Rihab Rabbani: each other.
Absir Ahmed Khan: You are absolutely right life, just gets in the way, you know, but let's make a
Absir Ahmed Khan: conscious effort. Maybe we could do some coffee next weekend, if you're here.
i220915 Absir Ahmed: If I,
Rihab Rabbani: That sounds great. Let me check my schedule and text you I think I should be
Rihab Rabbani: free on Saturday afternoon.
Absir Ahmed Khan: Perfect. It will be nice to catch a properly. Without it being rushed, there's
Absir Ahmed Khan: this new cafe. That opened up near Southern that's supposed to be really good.
Rihab Rabbani: Oh, I think I know which one are you talking about? I have seen it on Instagram.
Rihab Rabbani: Their coffee looks amazing.
Absir Ahmed Khan: Let's try it then. Okay, I should probably get going. I have a meeting in about
Absir Ahmed Khan: 20 minutes that I need to prep for
Rihab Rabbani: No problem. Thanks for taking the time to chat. It was really good seeing you
Rihab Rabbani: upset.
Absir Ahmed Khan: Likewise, I'll text you about Saturday and we'll finalize the details.
Rihab Rabbani: Sounds good. Take care. And try not to work too hard. I will try this.
Absir Ahmed Khan: I will, I will try my best. You take care to see you soon.
Rihab Rabbani: By.
Absir Ahmed Khan: Bye.
